ES6-Types

### MAP

#### Feature

- keep the order of insertion;
- can be iterated;

#### APIs

- when using constructor, one key is invalid, the whole initialization is aborted.

- set() method returns WeakMap instance so can chain it. 

  ```javascript
  map.set('key1', 'val1').set('key2', 'val2');
  ```

- has(''key1') return Boolean, get('key1') return the value;
- delete('key1') delete the key1/val1 pair, clear() remove all key/value pairs.

#### WM

cousin of Map type, has subset APIs of Map's APIs.

feature:

- can't iterate it and clear()

utility:

- private member :
  - [ ] why

- DOM node *:

```javascript
const wm = new WeakMap(); // const map = new Map();
const button = document.guerySelector('#submit');

wm.set(button, {disable: true})

 // if it was map, the #submit DOM node will remain if map still in memory or button not removed from map even the submit button is removed from DOM tree. 
```

#### Others

- [x]  Map vs Object in performance :
  - Memory: **Map** is better;
  - Insertion: **Map** is faster;
  - Lookup: **Object** is better;
  - Delete: **Map** is faster.



### SET

The most important thing about set is the value of each item is unique. Besides,

- reference unique/ value unique;
- keep the insertion order.

#### APIs:

- add() is chainable;
- delete() return Boolean;

#### Weakset

- same APIs with Set()
- can't iterate it
- same with WM, good for DOM node clean-up
