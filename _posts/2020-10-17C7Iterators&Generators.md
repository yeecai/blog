Cleaner, faster and easier way to to traverse a collection.

### Iterator

The basic way that iterate an array is to use index and loop to traverse the whole collection. But it's not good to iterate  the others:

- you have to know the data structure, e.g. how to index it, data structure such as Map doesn't have [] operator;
- order might be different in other data structure.

Iterator of Array is not closable.
